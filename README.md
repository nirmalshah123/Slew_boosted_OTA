# Slew_boosted_OTA

Developed an OTA, and enhanced it's slew rate using an auxillary circuit, that would provide exrta current.

Schematic was taken from the reference paper, and the specifications from the problem statement.

THe entire OTA was simulated in NGspice with 130nm technology, and was iterated to achieve the desired specification.
